# Project requirement

**Goal:**  Working on real marketing data and going through the challenges faced in marketing analytics.
1. Define the problem and get the data
2. Conduct the data analysis
3. Present the results

# Project description

Our project is about customer targeting. We want to know how customer demographics influence customer purchasing behavior.

Issues we faced:

1. Highly imbalanced dataset
2. Model choose
3. Variable selection

We solved these issues by:
1. Performed parameter tunings and utilized AUC as metric to choose proper parameters
2. Used logistic regression model to build model because the result of logistic regression model is easy to interpret. As our goal is to find which customer to target, we need the model result to be interpretable
3. Tried dummy variables, interaction variables, non-linear transformation to select proper variables

# Conclusion

1. Performed exploratory data analysis and data visualizations in Python to study the relationship between customer churn and other important factors 
2. Identified customers who are likely to churn using logistic regression model and analyzed the top factors that influence user retention
3. Summarized findings in a formal report and proposed actionable suggestions to reduce churn rate by 30%
