# Project description

This project is about customer churn analysis. We want to know factors affecting customer churn, and proposed actionable suggestions to reduce churn rate 

Issues we faced:

1. Highly imbalanced dataset
2. Model choose

We solved these issues by:
1. Performed parameter tunings and utilized recall rate as metric to choose proper parameters
2. Used logistic regression model to build model because the result of logistic regression model is easy to interpret. As our goal is to identify factors affecting customer churn, we need the model result to be interpretable

# Conclusion

1. Performed exploratory data analysis and data visualizations in Python to study the relationship between customer churn and other important factors 
2. Identified customers who are likely to churn using logistic regression model and analyzed the top factors that influence user retention
3. Summarized findings in a formal report and proposed actionable suggestions to reduce churn rate by 30%
